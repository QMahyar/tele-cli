# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed
- `--json` command failures are wrapped in the standard envelope (`ok: false` + additive `error` field) instead of a bare stderr line
- config-load failures exit 1 on every command, not only `listen`
- `account remove --name all` and `account login --name all` are rejected with a usage error (exit 1)
- `listen --dry-run` emits one JSONL row per selected account
- numeric chat ids of uncached basic groups resolve via a chat-kind retry (fixes `request error: dropped (cancelled)` on group commands from accounts without the group cached)
- `takeout finish` wraps `FinishTakeoutSession` in `InvokeWithTakeout` (fixes `TAKEOUT_REQUIRED` and orphaned takeout sessions)
- `msg forward --silent` no longer errors after a successful RPC (extracts ids from `updatesCombined`; bounds-safe chunk indexing)
- `msg delete` reports partial deletions honestly (`deleted < requested` exits 2)
- `msg send`/`msg edit` reject empty or whitespace-only `--text` with a usage error (exit 1) before connect
- `msg send --file`/`profile set --photo` reject nonexistent paths (exit 1) before connect; upload/download path guards are case-insensitive on Windows with no raw-path fallback
- `validate_markdown` accepts URLs that merely contain `tg://user?id=`; only genuine mentions are validated
- `chat join` accepts scheme-less `t.me/...` and `telegram.me/...` invite links, and caches the joined chat's access_hash for follow-up id commands
- `chat participants` on basic groups no longer panics on members with missing user data
- `chat create --kind group` ids are resolvable via `--chat <id>` immediately after creation
- `+phone` peer resolution no longer persists a contact-list side effect
- `listen` skips `MessageEmpty` updates (no stream panic), probes `updates.GetState` before streaming (fail-fast on takeout/auth errors), exits 1 on config/credential failures, and reconnects with bounded backoff
- `takeout export` wraps `GetContacts` in `InvokeWithTakeout`
- `write_config` preserves comments and unknown keys (via `toml_edit`)
- `raw` rejects empty/whitespace `--args` values with a usage error
- empty `TELE_API_HASH=` is rejected instead of silently accepted
